    We are unable to display the results for model run #XXX. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to
    provide a satisfactory solution for displaying and/or recovering results created using older versions of
    PolicyBrain. Here is one option for re-creating your results:
</h2>

<h3>
    Go to the <a href=http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/edit/{{ unique_url.pk }}/?start_year={{fill_in_start_year}}>input page</a> and
    re-submit your parameters using the current version of PolicyBrain. Note that for older runs
    some parameters may have been deprecated. We recommend
    <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/tree/{{taxcalc_version}}"> Tax-Calculator's</a> documentation for alternative parameter choices.

<h3>
    The Tax-Calculator package may have more options for re-creating results with the exact version of
    the package used in this run. For more details, please contact the OSPC team.
