It is comprised of heterogeneous individuals, perfectly competitive firms, and a government with a balanced budget requirement. Firms make a static profit maximization decision in which they rent capital and hire labor to maximize profits given a Cobb-Douglas production function. The government levies taxes on individuals and makes lump sum transfers to individuals according to a balanced budget constraint. In its current form the model presents a relatively rich set of heterogeneous households, but less in the production sector and a simple government sector.  Work in extending the model along these dimensions is ongoing.\r\nOG-USA interacts with Tax-Calculator, an open source economic microsimulation model available at www.github.com/open-source-economics/tax-calculator.  It does so in the following way. The user will enter changes to the individual income tax code he wishes to evaluate via the TaxBrain interface.  These tax policy parameters are then used to in the calculation of marginal and effective tax rates for individuals in the microdata underlying Tax-Calculator.  These marginal and effective tax rates are then use to estimate marginal and effective tax rate functions that are used in OG-USA, determining how model households respond to changes in tax policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proper use of this tool and a description of that use is your responsibility.
